Tridion-BusinessConnector version 0.03
======================================

This module provides a handy interface to the Tridion CMS' SOAP interface,
known as the "Business Connector" in their documentation. It handles things
like escaping passwords, XML namespaces, request/response formats, and stuff
like that.

This is the first version, and as such provides only a few functions, mainly
at low levels. For everything other than GetItem and SaveItem issues, you will
use the execute() function. At a later date I will add direct functions for
DeleteItem, GetList, Publish, Search, and so on.
